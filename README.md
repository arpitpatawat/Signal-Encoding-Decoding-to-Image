# Voice-Encoding
- The objective of This project is to convert any Audio file into an
encrypted Image file, so that any third party cannot have any access to
it.
- Then this particular encrypted image file will be sent to the desired
individual who will then convert it to a decrypted Audio File and get the
access of the data which was in the original Audio File.
- Doing this ensures our privacy, prevents identity theft and ransomware
blackmail and also allows us to securely share our files.

1. First you should have an audio signal and any image file (preferablly Plain Blue).
2. Now Run the Encryption Script, it will ask for audio and image file loaction so make sure you give the right address for both.
3. The Script will overwrite the image within a minute and you will be able to see the size and property of image is changed.
4. Run the Decryption Script and give path of the image, it will convert this image into audio signal with some small noise.
